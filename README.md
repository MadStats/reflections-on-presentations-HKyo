What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:
Lots of really illustrated and beautiful visiulizations

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:
One thing I'm worried is about the media coverage, which is really hard to 
capture. It's hard to know whether the coverage about mass shooting is increasing, or there were just more news overall.Maybe controling the data sources to some major outlets?





Title of presentation: Voting

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:
The design of the variable that indicates whether the person actually vote 
is really good. I also like the pre-processing the data before feeding to random
forest.

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:


What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:

How can you tell the worse performance of a predicting method is the result of lack
